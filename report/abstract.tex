\begin{abstract}
We present AccWeb (Accelerated Web), a web service that improves user experience of web browsing. AccWeb improves web performance by prefetching web resources when the user is typing in the address bar. In order to prefetch resources, AccWeb predicts the URL that the user wants to navigate. The prediction is based on the user's browsing history and typing behaviors. After a prediction is made, all demanded resources belonging to the predicted URL will be prefetched. Also, AccWeb gives users options to choose types of resources to prefetch -- users can select the types of resources to prefetch based on their own preferences as well as real-time network condition. We build an AccWeb prototype, and our experiments show that the performance of browsers installing AccWeb is much better than the performance of browsers without AccWeb.
