Prefetching content~\cite{padmanabhan1996using, jiang1998web} and predicting accurately what contents should be prefetched~\cite{palpanas1998web, nanopoulos2003data, chen2003popularity} were previous studied. However, they did not consider overheads of misprediction or limited bandwidth in real time. Some approaches (e.g.~\cite{fan1999web}) utilizes proxies to maximize low-bandwidth users' utility. One problem is that if proxies are down, then users cannot connect to the internet.
